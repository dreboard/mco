# Juice - Mixins for Life

Simplify your life. Juice is a collection of Sass mixins/functions that are used to minimize the work needed to apply styling/properties to elements. Juice is not just a collection to help with cross browser support, so it is best paired with autoprefixer, for the best possible browser compatibility.
